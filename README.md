## Changelog

### 6 February, 2024

#### Version 1.0.1
* Removed some extraneous code that's no longer needed due to vanilla API changes.
* Display names now reference the item itself, not its pluralization (i.e. the shopping list will say "lead slug" rather than "lead slugs".) This isn't an ideal solution, but it seems to be the only way to prevent name weirdness with books and the like. Future changes might include a patch around for this, if I can find one.

### 22 November, 2023
* Initial release.
