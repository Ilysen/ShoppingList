  "Title": "Shopping List",
  "Description": "This mod adds a character-specific shopping list that you can add things to. Whenever you load into a zone, if any merchants in that zone are stocking something from the list, you'll get a notification about it.\n\nYou can search for specific item types, data disks for item mods or blueprints, items with a certain mod (like [b]snail-encrusted[/b]), and pure liquids. Everything is internally documented through a little in-game tutorial prompt you can access by typing \"help\" into the item select, so you won't need to figure it out blind!\n\nYou can also export and import codes from a list, allowing you to set up configurations and use them across saves. Imports are done additively, so you can import multiple codes at once (like one for every run and one for True Kin only that has specific cybernetics) and they'll merge gracefully together.\n\nSome quirks to remember:[list][*]Merchants with items from your shopping list will be highlighted in flashing pink and purple. You can disable this in the game settings.[*]Once you acquire a data disk from your shopping list, it'll be automatically removed. You can disable this in the game settings.[*]Only items you can understand (i.e. by identifying them or having techscanning) will be picked up by the list; you can have polygel on your list, but even if a merchant has some, the list won't recognize it if you only see it as a weird artifact.[*]The list is checked each time you enter a zone. You can also run a manual scan from the main interface.[*][b]You can add this mod to existing saves, but you cannot remove it from a save without causing errors.[/b][/list]\n\nYou can find this mod's source code on [url=https://github.com/Ilysen/ShoppingList]GitHub[/url], under the GPL v3 license.",
